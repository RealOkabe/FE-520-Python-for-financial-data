    "    Develop a Python program that generates a loan amortization schedule. The program should include functions to perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "   (1) Input Loan Details: Allow the user to input the loan amount, annual interest rate, and loan term (in years).\\\n",
    "   (2) Calculate Monthly Payments: Implement a function to calculate monthly payments using the standard formula.\\\n",
    "   (3) Generate Amortization Schedule: Create a schedule showing the breakdown of each monthly payment into principal and interest, along with the remaining loan balance.\\\n",
    "   (4) Display the Schedule: Neatly display the amortization schedule in a tabular format."
